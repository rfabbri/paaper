- nice quote on the greater importance of processes over products:

"Nothing is more important than to see the sources of invention which are, in my
opinion, more interesting than the inventions themselves"
-- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (from Koenderink's solid shape)



"Central to our feelings of awareness is the sensation of the progression of
time... As we consciously perceive time to pass, the most immediate part of that
vast and seemingly undetermined future continuously becomes realized as
actuality, and thus makes its entry into the fixed past."
-- Roger Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind

Which can be adapted to AA as

"Central to our feelings of awareness is the sensation of the progression of
time... (aa logging increases this sensation and thus awarenes, an awareness
which equals more productivity, of the creative type, at least) As we
consciously perceive time to pass (through AA sessions),
the most immediate part of that vast and seemingly undetermined future
continuously becomes realized as actuality (AA logs), and thus makes its entry into the
fixed (highly indexable and searchable) past." 
-- Modified Roger Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind
