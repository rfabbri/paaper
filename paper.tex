\section{Introduction}

One of the defining features of modern times is the widening geographical
distribution of software teams~\cite{}. One example is the free software
movement. \todo{citar alguns exemplos}.

However, we have noticed how difficult it is to coordinate and fund free
software on a larger scale than currently available, when teams are very
heterogeneous containing not only volutaries and very experienced developers,
but also contractors from different backgrounds and cultures.

Another problem faced by modern software companies and other collectives are frequent
ineffective meetings, which are seldom focused to the interest to any
attendant. The result is that it has become the norm to participate in too many
meetings with the laptop open, which is very unproductive at the very least.
Coders like to code, to be productive, to have their hands-on their project to
do what they're best at. They hate to have to stop for too many meetings,
and they hate to have to write lengthy reports to justify their funding.

AA is a methodology and an associated software system for coordinating
distributed teamwork.  Team members take on an egalitarian role, and stay
voluntarily logged in the system for part of their time (e.g., 2h/day), during
which they microblog periodical "tweets" about their activity. These microblog
logs are publicly aggregated and are validated by their own peers. Through AA,
we have a methodology and an associated system to validate and enable the
activities of a distributed software team. It implicitly legitimizes financing
the expansions of the team's activity. The AA methodology is specially useful
for coordinating distributed and decentralized teamwork, providing effective
means to asyncrhonously update different team members without the need for
syncrhonous unproductive meetings.

Figure~\ref{fig:mm} summarizes our methodology.

\section{The AA Methodology}

\subsection{AA Session}

From the developer perspective, the AA methodology is based on creating pretty
small high perspective reports of what they're doing in a specific timeframe,
that can be something between 5 to 15 minutes, depending in what is more
confortable for the developer, an AA Session would be a period of at least 2hrs
doing these reports. The developer can set reminders to show up when its time
to make a new report.

The objective of the flexible timeframe and reminders is to don't generate much
overhead for the developer to be in an AA session, so he can make the reports
and also concentrate in his code.

Each report can be sent directly to the an online server, or cached locally in
a log for sending later, this is necessary to make possible for developers that are
offline to use AA without problems.

The developer can also add a screencast in the end of session to make a summary
of what has been done in the session, explaining with his words and showing his
results, possibly making some points more easily understandable then with only
the reports from the AA session.

\subsection{AA Site Report}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
   \caption{
   AA Version 0.1
   }
\label{fig:aaserver}
\end{figure}

All AA reports made by the developers are sent to a web site and become public,
being possible then for a manager or another developer to follow very closely
the work of a developer, nearly real-time, reading each of his small reports of
what he is doing.

Another possibility is to check older sessions to see when sometimes was done
and the comments of the developer about it, since each AA post happens in a
very small timeframe of work, the information about what was done become very
easy to understand, instead of only of report in the end of a session.

The site is where the developer can add to his session a link for his
screencast about that session, a video summary of what was done to complement
the reports, useful specially on cases where the small reports were done in a
hurry, because the developer didn't want to lose his focus on something
important at that moment.

\subsection{Validation}

Each developer AA Session must be validated by another developer, it means that
all reports are read by someone that will consider then valid as reports for
that session of work, so the session doesn't gets lost on the site, the
developer in charge of validating a session is decided randomly.
